Overview

This project uses the Scapy Python library to read packets from a .pcap capture file and extract checksum values of different network protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP.
The program helps in verifying packet integrity by displaying the checksum values of captured network traffic.

Features

Reads packets from a PCAP file

Displays checksum values for:

IP packets

TCP segments

UDP datagrams

ICMP packets

Useful for network traffic analysis and academic experiments involving checksum validation
